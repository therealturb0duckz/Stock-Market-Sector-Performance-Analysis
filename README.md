# Stock-Market-Analysis-by-Sector

### üìà Project Overview
This project conducts comprehensive analysis of stock market performance across various industry sectors to support sustainable investment decision-making. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical inference, we investigate sector behaviors, correlations, and performance metrics to identify promising opportunities for long-term investing.



### üéØ Objectives
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between industry sectors' stock returns  
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Evaluate sector performance during key pandemic periods  
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess sectors' risk-adjusted returns over a 5-year period  
- **Investment Insights**: Identify stable and promising sectors for sustainable investing  



### üîç Research Questions
1. Which industry sectors exhibit the strongest correlations in their stock price returns?  
2. How did different sectors perform during key COVID-19 periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic onset, and recovery)?  
3. Which industry sectors offer the best risk-adjusted returns over 5 years?  


### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 3.10.3
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Statistical Analysis**: scipy, statsmodels
  
### üìä Analysis Methodology
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation)  
- Time series plotting and trend analysis  
- Sector-wise distribution analysis  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Outlier detection using box plots
  
#### Statistical Inference

| Q1 | Which industry sectors exhibit the strongest correlations in their stock price returns?                     | Spearman correlation | Assess strength and direction of monotonic relationships between sector return pairs         |
| Q2 | How did different sectors perform during key COVID-19 periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic onset, and recovery)? | Kruskal-Wallis test  | Compare sector returns across different COVID-19 periods (non-parametric test for 3+ groups) |
| Q3 | Which industry sectors offer the best risk-adjusted returns over 5 years                                    | Kruskal-Wallis test  | Compare Sharpe ratios across sectors to identify differences in risk-adjusted performance    |

### üìä Key Findings (To be filled)

#### Correlation Analysis (Q1)
- **Strongest correlations**: [Sector A - Sector B]: r = 0.XX
- **Weakest correlations**: [List sectors]
- **Insight**: Sector X and Sector Y show high correlation (r > 0.7)

#### COVID-19 Impact (Q2)
| Period | Best Performer | Worst Performer | Avg Return |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Pre-pandemic | Sector X | Sector Y | +X% |
| Pandemic onset | Sector X  | Sector Y | -X% |
| Recovery | Sector X  | Sector Y | +X% |

### Risk-Adjusted Returns (Q3)
- **Highest Sharpe Ratio**: Technology 
- **Most Stable**: 
- **Recommendation**:

### üìú About The Project
This project was developed as part of a data science coursework with a focus on practical financial analysis applications.
I plan to extend it into another project that explores my personal interest in finance in the future.
