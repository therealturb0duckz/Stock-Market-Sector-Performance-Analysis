# Stock-Market-Analysis-by-Sector

### 📈 Project Overview
This project conducts comprehensive analysis of stock market performance across various industry sectors to support sustainable investment decision-making. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical inference, we investigate sector behaviors, correlations, and performance metrics to identify promising opportunities for long-term investing.



### 🎯 Objectives
- **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze correlations between industry sectors' stock returns  
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Evaluate sector performance during key pandemic periods  
- **Risk Assessment**: Assess sectors' risk-adjusted returns over a 5-year period  
- **Investment Insights**: Identify stable and promising sectors for sustainable investing  



### 🔍 Research Questions
1. Which industry sectors exhibit the strongest correlations in their stock price returns?  
2. How did different sectors perform during key COVID-19 periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic onset, and recovery)?  
3. Which industry sectors offer the best risk-adjusted returns over 5 years?  


### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 3.10.3
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy  
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Statistical Analysis**: scipy, statsmodels

| Q1 | Which industry sectors exhibit the strongest correlations in their stock price returns?                     | Spearman correlation | Assess strength and direction of monotonic relationships between sector return pairs         |
| Q2 | How did different sectors perform during key COVID-19 periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic onset, and recovery)? | Kruskal-Wallis test  | Compare sector returns across different COVID-19 periods (non-parametric test for 3+ groups) |
| Q3 | Which industry sectors offer the best risk-adjusted returns over 5 years                                    | Kruskal-Wallis test  | Compare Sharpe ratios across sectors to identify differences in risk-adjusted performance    |

### 📜 About The Project
This project was developed as part of a data science coursework with a focus on practical financial analysis applications.
I plan to extend it into another project that explores my personal interest in finance in the future.
